# NJIT PROFILE

This is a handmade profile page for my NJIT ACS webpage. This in an excersize in writing a Javascript defined UI using only ES6 modules and no libraries from npm.

### Music Widget

Music widget is currently defined in `util.js` as needs for this grows it will slowly be moved into it's own module for organization.

###

This page is to contain useful links and I may even spin up hugo on this instance to
make things look nicer should I get enough interest on my page.
